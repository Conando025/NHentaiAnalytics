        <h3>About</h3>
        NHentaiAnalytics is a Chrome/Firefox extension to help you find the best doujinshi based on your favorites.<br/><br/>
        When you first open it, it'll get all your favorite tags from NHentai (you must be logged in for this to work)<br/>
        Then it will be able to give you suggestions based on these tags, avoiding tags you blacklisted or ignored (tags that are in none of the doujinshi you favorited)
        <hr/>
        <h3>Tags doesn't load</h3>
        If you have a message saying tags aren't loaded and waiting doesn't help, try reloading the doujinshi list by going in settings then press "Update".<br/>
        Loading tags take appromatively 1 second per doujinshi.<br/>
        That means if you have a huge number of favorite you may hvae to wait several minutes.
