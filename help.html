        NHentaiAnalytics is a Chrome/Firefox extension to help you find the best doujinshi based on your favorites.
        <hr/>
        If you have a message saying tags aren't loaded and waiting doesn't help, try reloading the doujinshi list by going in settings then press "Update".<br/>
        Loading tags take appromatively 1 second per doujinshi.<br/>
        That means if you have a huge number of favorite you may hvae to wait several minutes.
